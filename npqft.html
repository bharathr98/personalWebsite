							<h2>The sign problem and the Lefschetz thimbles formalism</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Feynman’s path integrals – functional integrals over all quantum mechanically possible trajectories – have proven to be a useful formulation of studying quantum systems, especially in field theory since it is easier to implement Lorentz covariance.<br><br>For many physically relevant systems, the partition function path integral is difficult to calculate numerically since the action in these cases takes complex values, making the integrand oscillatory. Many ways of solving this problem, called the sign problem, have been proposed, but they avoid it by proposing alternate methods of finding the partition function without having to solve the integral. However, in recent times, Picard-Lefschetz theory and the associated Lefschetz thimbles have proven promising in evading the sign problem.<br><br>In this novel method of calculating integrals, the original space of degrees of freedom is complexified, thus making it an integral over a submanifold. Futher, the generalisation of Cauchy's integral theorem to complex manifolds is used to deform the submanifold such that the imaginary part of the action remains constant on the deformed manifold. This removes the issue of oscillations in the integral (apart from a possible, 'milder' sign problem introduced by the Jacobian), making it easier to numerically calculate the partition function.<br><br>An advantage of using Picard-Lefschetz theory to deal with the sign problem, is the fact that the structure of these deformed submanifolds called Lefschetz thimbles, give an enormous amount of information about the system. In this project, I focus on one such feature -- Stokes phenomena. Stokes phenomena refers to abrupt changes to the thimbles as one varies the parameters of the theory. This abrupt change gives us information about phase transitions in the system. As a part of the project, I looked at mathematical ways to predicting these phase transitions for models in zero-dimensions. <br><br>This work is currently being carried out as an intern in <a href="http://14.139.227.202/Faculty/anoshjoseph/index.html">Dr Anosh Joseph's group</a> at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali.</p>
